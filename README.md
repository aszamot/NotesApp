# Note-Taking Application

## About the Application

This note-taking application was created as a demonstration of implementing clean architecture within the Android ecosystem. Below are the main technologies and design patterns used in the application.

## Technologies and Architecture

### Clean Architecture
The structure of the application is based on the principles of clean architecture, which ensures a clear separation of responsibilities between the presentation, domain, and data layers. This structure facilitates testing, development, and maintenance of the code.

### Room
The Room library is used to manage the local SQLite database. Room offers strong typing and safe execution of SQL queries, accelerating development and improving application stability.

### Android Jetpack
The application utilizes components from Android Jetpack, such as:
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and lifecycle.
- **Navigation**: Handles navigation and transitions between screens.

### Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
Using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for handling asynchronous operations and data streams. Flow allows emitting streams of data that are easy to observe and manipulate.

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
The MVVM architectural pattern is applied to separate business logic from the presentation layer. ViewModel holds the logic and data, while the View is responsible for their presentation.

## Testing the Application

Testing is an integral part of the development process for this application. We use the following testing libraries to ensure code quality and reliability:

- **JUnit**: The basic library for writing unit tests in Java and Kotlin.
- **Mockito-Kotlin**: A library for creating mocks and stubs in Kotlin, facilitating the testing of dependencies and interactions between components.
- **AndroidX Test Libraries**:
  - **JUnit for Android**: JUnit extensions for instrumentation tests in the Android environment.
  - **Espresso**: A library for UI testing. It allows simulating user interactions with the application and checking the state of views.
  - **Core Testing**: A set of testing tools provided by AndroidX, supporting various aspects of testing on the Android platform.
  - **Lifecycle Runtime Testing**: Tools for testing lifecycle-aware components (e.g., ViewModel).
- **Kotlinx Coroutines Test**: Tools for testing code based on Kotlin Coroutines, including testing asynchronous functions.
- **Turbine**: A library for testing Flow streams, allowing easy assertions on emitted values in streams.

## Purpose of the Application

The application was created to demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to building mobile applications using clean architecture. This example is useful for developers as a model for learning and implementing scalable, modular Android applications.

## Summary

The note-taking application illustrates the practical use of modern technologies and design patterns in Android application development. The implementation of clean architecture using Room, Android Jetpack, and Kotlin Coroutines and Flow allows for the creation of a robust, maintainable, and testable application.
